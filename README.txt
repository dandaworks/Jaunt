My final includes two main changes.. the first one being a dash mechanic! By holding down the left shift key John Lemon dashes forward at a significant 1.5x speed. To accomplish this I created a float variable "SprintModifier" that gets multiplied to the m_Movement base character speed! The other change was a timer mechanic where if you don't meet the finish line under a certain time you "Get Caught". Doing this was a long process but it required a canvas, slider element, a new line of code "Countdown Timer", and a few key changes to game object and public variables/classes. Using the already created gameEnding.CaughtPlayer() element I had an easy time getting the game to end.
